# Liver Cirrhosis Survival Prediction Dataset

## Overview
This dataset focuses on predicting the survival state of patients suffering from liver cirrhosis. It includes 17 clinical features collected from a study on primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver. The study was carried out at the Mayo Clinic from 1974 to 1984.

Liver cirrhosis is a condition characterized by extensive scarring of the liver, often resulting from prolonged liver damage due to factors like hepatitis or chronic alcohol consumption. This dataset aims to assist in understanding the progression and potential outcomes of the disease.

## Survival States
The dataset categorizes patients into three survival states:
- `0 = D (death)`
- `1 = C (censored)`
- `2 = CL (censored due to liver transplantation)`

## Clinical Features
The dataset includes 17 clinical features, which are crucial in predicting the survival state of a patient. These features encompass various medical metrics and patient history details.

## Data Source
The data is sourced from a comprehensive Mayo Clinic study on primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver, carried out over a decade from 1974 to 1984. This study provides valuable insights into the progression of liver cirrhosis and its potential outcomes.

## Usage
This dataset is intended for research purposes, particularly in the fields of medical research, epidemiology, and predictive modeling. It can be used to develop predictive models for the survival states of liver cirrhosis patients or for statistical analysis to understand the progression of the disease.
